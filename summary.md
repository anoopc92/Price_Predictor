🎨 Data Handling & Preprocessing

🌐 The app fetches historical price data from Yahoo Finance or CSV files.

📅 Data must include Date and Close prices; Open, High, Low, Volume are optional.

🕰️ Dates are converted to proper datetime format.

🔢 Data is sorted chronologically to maintain the time sequence.

❌ Any missing or NaN values are removed.

📊 The Close prices are normalized to a range of 0–1 using MinMaxScaler.

⚡ Normalization helps the neural network train faster and avoid large numerical errors.

🔄 A lookback window (e.g., 60 days) is chosen to feed past data into the model.

🧩 Creating Input & Output Sequences

🧮 Each training example consists of the lookback previous days of Close prices.

🎯 The target value is the Close price immediately after the lookback window.

🗂️ This creates X (inputs) and y (outputs) arrays for training the LSTM.

🔢 Inputs are reshaped into 3D arrays [samples, timesteps, features] for LSTM.

⏳ This captures the sequential, time-dependent nature of the data.

🧠 LSTM Model Logic

🔄 LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network specialized for sequences.

🧩 It remembers patterns across long sequences using memory cells.

🚪 Each LSTM cell uses gates to decide what to keep, forget, or output.

🛡️ Dropout layers prevent overfitting by randomly ignoring neurons.

🎯 The final Dense layer outputs a single predicted price for the next day.

📉 The model is trained to minimize Mean Squared Error (MSE) between predicted and actual prices.

⚙️ Training & Optimization

📊 Data is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

🔁 The model trains over multiple epochs, repeatedly updating weights.

⚡ The Adam optimizer adjusts weights to reduce MSE efficiently.

⏱️ Training progress is monitored in real time using a Streamlit callback.

✅ A validation split (10%) checks for overfitting during training.

📏 Evaluation Metrics

📌 RMSE measures average prediction error magnitude.

📌 MAE measures average absolute error.

📌 MAPE measures prediction error in percentage terms.

📊 These metrics quantify how well the model predicts unseen data.

🔮 Prediction & Forecasting

📈 After training, the model predicts the test set and future prediction_days.

🔄 Future predictions are generated recursively: the last predicted value becomes part of the input for the next prediction.
